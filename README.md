* Gun Game: add increment weapon powerup, powerup model is the weapon they will receive, powerup is hidden and ungrabbable to all other players

## TESTING:

* Ceiling spawn cancels on Moon
* Check if zombies are bleeding out on any maps while doing normal strats (add print statement to zombie failsafe death)

## MAYBE:
* Ascension: double tap obtainable by having every other perk on the map? (gained as soon as you get all perks, lost if you lose one)
* Shangri-La: should mud pit sidequest step need the radio to be activated to work?
* Moon: should teleporter gate start going down before power is on?
* Should zombies not double swipe if player doesnt have jug?
* Should there be a zombie spawn delay?
